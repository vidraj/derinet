# DeriNet

DeriNet is a network of Czech derivational relations. This repository
contains tools that are needed to build it from the base set of lemmas,
annotations used in the process, auxiliary scripts and the released
versions.

The homepage of the project, which contains an overview of the project
and introductory information, can be found at [https://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/derinet](https://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/derinet).

Developer documentation, including instructions for building the DeriNet
databases from scratch, is given in [doc/README.md](doc/README.md).

Released versions are stored in [data/releases/cs/](data/releases/cs/)
and can be searched online using [DeriSearch](https://quest.ms.mff.cuni.cz/derisearch2/v2/databases/).
