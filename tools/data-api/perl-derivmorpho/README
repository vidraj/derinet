We require Ufal::MorphoDiTa for normal usage.

Treex::Tool::Lexicon::DerivDict::Dictionary is required for legacy
code, but you shouldn't need that. If you do, you can find it in
a Git version of Treex at https://github.com/ufal/treex.git
See https://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/treex/install.html for installation
instructions of Treex.
