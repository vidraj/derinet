We require Treex::Core::Log, Treex::Tool::Lexicon::CS and
Treex::Tool::Lexicon::Generation::CS for normal usage and the latter
also requires Ufal::MorphoDiTa.
Treex::Tool::Lexicon::DerivDict::Dictionary is required for legacy
code, but you shouldn't need that.

The prerequisities are not satisfiable by installing the standard
version of Treex, you need the Git version from
https://github.com/ufal/treex.git

See
https://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/treex/install.html
for installation instructions.
