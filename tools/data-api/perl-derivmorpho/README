This directory stores the old Perl API for DeriNet versions 0.9 through
1.2. Version 1.3 is partially built using Perl and partially in the new
Python API. Since a full rebuild works through all the steps in
sequence, this API is still needed for releasing new versions.

You need the following Perl modules to use the API:
Moose
MooseX::SemiAffordanceAccessor
PerlIO::via::gzip
Readonly
Ufal::MorphoDiTa

You can get a Perl installation working by following step 1 the Treex
installation tutorial at https://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/treex/install.html
and then running
cpanm Moose MooseX::SemiAffordanceAccessor PerlIO::via::gzip Readonly Ufal::MorphoDiTa

Treex::Tool::Lexicon::DerivDict::Dictionary is required for legacy
code, but you shouldn't need that. If you do, you can find it in
a Git version of Treex at https://github.com/ufal/treex.git
See https://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/treex/install.html for installation
instructions of Treex.
