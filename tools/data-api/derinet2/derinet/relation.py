class Relation(object, metaclass=ABCMeta):  # Defining it as Relation(ABC) doesn't mix well with slots usage – it doesn't prevent __dict__ from forming.
    """
    A base class for all network relations. A relation is a graph multiedge pointing from the word-formational
    parent (antecedent) to the word-formation child (descendant). It may have multiple parents (compounding) and,
    at the time, just a single child. But if there is a case for multiple children, we will add that as well.

    Do not instantiate this class directly, use its subclasses.

    In the 2.0 version of the DeriNet API, relations are explicit objects. However, they don't get an ID
    (nor does anything else) and they are not explicitly stored anywhere – they are only accessible from
    their incident lexemes. A reference to the relation is stored in all parents.
