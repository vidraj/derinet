# The lexeme class
# Must have all the fields from the DeriNet 2.0 documentation.
# Do we want the base fields (lemma, techlemma, POS, …) to be modifiable?
#  Probably not.
# The other fields should have proper getters and setters.
# We want to store full history of changes – especially reconnections.
#  This can be done as in Perl, by storing a list of former relations for each lexeme. Do we store it in parents as well, or only in the children?
#  Another way is to make the lexeme immutable and store history as references to older versions of the lexeme.
#   This probably requires that relations store an array offset, not a pointer, so that they always point to the newest version.
#    This prevents us from reconstructing the whole state of the network at a given point in time, but the Perl solution
#    didn't allow this anyway and it was good enough.
#   And it is hard to serialize to the textual format, so no no no, we won't be doing this.
