    Use the morpheme information contained in the various CELEXes to infer

    The CELEX annotation contains two major pieces of information: The stem

    as-is, because their spelling is normalized. For example, “Abdikation” has
    stem list “abdiz;ation”.

    But sometimes, the spelling does match. In that case, the stem list can be
    used to find boundaries in the lemma and the morpheme list can be used to
    delimit individual morphs and assign them the somewhat-disambiguated
    morpheme string.

    And even when the spelling does not match, if there is only one non-matching
    part, the matching ones can be delimited accurately and the rest corresponds
    to the non-matching one. With the example above, we know that the stem
    “abdiz” corresponds to the lemma substring “Abdik”, because that's the only
