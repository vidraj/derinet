DeriNet 1.4 was created from DeriNet 1.3 by adding manual annotations from the file final_sorted, which Zdenek received by email from Adela on 15th March.

The content of this directory is currently only copied from https://svn.ms.mff.cuni.cz/svn/home_zabokrtsky/devel/derinet/nikita, and it not made functioning yet (it should be sufficient to fix paths though).
