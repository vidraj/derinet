# DeriNet 1.5.1

Created by manually splitting erroneous cycles present in the released
DeriNet 1.5. No new annotations are present in this version.

Do not use the attached Makefile as an intermediary step for building new
versions. Base new versions directly on 1.5 â€“ the code bug producing the
cycles is already fixed and should stay that way.
